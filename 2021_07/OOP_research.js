/*
You are given an object literal representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.

You start with an updateRecords function that takes an object literal, records, containing the musical album collection, an id, a prop (like artist or tracks), and a value. Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

    Your function must always return the entire record collection object.
    If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, update or set that album's prop to value.
    If prop is tracks but the album doesn't have a tracks property, create an empty array and add value to it.
    If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, add value to the end of the album's existing tracks array.
    If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.

Note: A copy of the recordCollection object is used for the tests.

/*
Make a function that looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that have matching name and value pairs (second argument). Each name and value pair of the source object has to be present in the object from the collection if it is to be included in the returned array.

For example, if the first argument is [{ first: "Romeo", last: "Montague" }, { first: "Mercutio", last: null }, { first: "Tybalt", last: "Capulet" }], and the second argument is { last: "Capulet" }, then you must return the third object from the array (the first argument), because it contains the name and its value, that was passed on as the second argument.
